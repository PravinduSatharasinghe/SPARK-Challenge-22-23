# SPARK-Challenge-22-23
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our team project for the SPARK challenge 22/23 which was held by the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. This project was a thrilling and very exciting one with demonstrated the power of wireless communication and AI in a competitive environment.

# Aqua Doc - Overview
Aqua Doc is a smart life jacket that comes with multiple abilities compared to an ordinary one. With an ordinary life jacket, the wearer can stay stable in the water and that's all. Aqua Doc is the successor of those life jackets since it comes with systematic applications to communicate with the other parties and also has the ability to keep the wearer stable and straight in water, despite of the fact whether he/she is conscious or unconscious.

# Devices Used
Since this is a limited-size project, we propose to use a radio beacon as the communicating device. Aqua Doc is rather a systematic application than a specific life jacket. So, it can be applied to any ordinary life jacket that is available in the market.
