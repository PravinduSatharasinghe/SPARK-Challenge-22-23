# Aqua Doc - Overview
Aqua Doc is a smart life jacket that comes with multi abilities compared to an ordinary one. With an ordinary life jacket, wearer can stay stable in the water and that's all. Aqua Doc is the successor of those life jackets, since it comes with systematci applications to communicate with the other parties and also has the ability to keep wearer stable and straight in water, despite of the fact whether he/she is conscious or unconscious.

# Devices Used
Since, this is a limited size project, we propose to use radio beacon as the communicating device. Aqua Doc is rather a systematic application than a specific life jacket. So, it can be applied to any ordinary life jacket that is available in the market.
